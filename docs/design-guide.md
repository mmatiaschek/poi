# Corporate Design Guide — POI / SIS Ledger (Light, Trust-First Edition)

This version **intentionally discards** the previous dark / tech-heavy palette.
It is rebuilt **from scratch**, driven ONLY by:

* the two donor personas
* the failure analysis of development aid
* the core promise: *Proof over stories. Transparency builds trust.*

The result is a **light, calm, serious, human-first corporate design** that feels:

* credible without being cold
* modern without being crypto
* rigorous without being bureaucratic

---

## 1. Brand positioning (visual translation)

**What donors need to feel in 3 seconds:**

* “This is trustworthy.”
* “This is not hype.”
* “This respects my intelligence.”

**Design principles:**

1. Light over dark (openness beats secrecy)
2. Paper, not neon (audit > startup)
3. Calm contrast, not drama
4. Evidence-first layouts
5. Warm restraint (human, not playful)

Think: *international development bank report* × *modern civic tech platform*.

## 2. Core color system (new, light, serious)

This palette is designed to work **beautifully on white**, print well, and feel familiar to donors from Africa, India, and the Global South.

### Primary colors

**Ivory White (Base)**

* #FAFAF7
* Main background
* Conveys openness, paper, neutrality

**Charcoal Ink (Text / Structure)**

* #1F2933
* Primary text, headers, tables
* Softer than black, highly readable

**Deep Teal (Trust Accent)**

* #0F766E
* Buttons, links, key highlights
* Signals seriousness + modern governance

### Secondary / supportive colors

**Warm Sand (Panels / Cards)**

* #F1EFE8
* Background for cards, sections, reports
* Evokes documents, reports, institutions

**Muted Gold (Value / Verification)**

* #C6A75E
* Used sparingly for:

  * verification icons
  * key numbers
  * seals / confirmations

**Slate Grey (Secondary Text)**

* #6B7280
* Metadata, timestamps, footnotes

### What we explicitly avoid

* Dark navy / black backgrounds
* Neon greens
* “Crypto gradients”
* Aggressive contrast

**Rule:** If it wouldn’t look good printed on paper, don’t use it.

---

## 3. Typography (clarity + dignity)

### Primary typeface (UI + web)

**Source Sans 3** (or Inter if preferred)

* Humanist, neutral, globally readable
* Excellent numerals
* Feels civic, not corporate

Usage:

* Body text: Regular
* Headings: Semibold
* UI labels: Medium

### Secondary typeface (long-form / reports)

**Source Serif 4**

* For whitepapers, reports, essays
* Signals seriousness and depth

### Typography rules

* No condensed fonts
* No ultra-light weights
* Generous line-height (1.5–1.6)
* Numbers always tabular in tables

**Design mantra:** readability is respect.

---

## 4. Logo direction (conceptual, not visual hype)

The logo should feel like:

* a mark on a report
* a stamp of verification
* a system identifier

### Strong directions

1. **Wordmark-first**

   * Clean typography
   * Optional small symbol
   * Scales well for documents and dashboards

2. **Verification mark**

   * Simple geometric symbol
   * Check, bracket, ledger line, or seal
   * Not a coin, not a chain

3. **Initial system**

   * POI or SIS as typographic mark
   * Neutral, institutional

### What to avoid

* Mascot in logo
* Abstract crypto shapes
* Complex symbols
* Anything that looks like a token

**Test:** Would a development bank put this on a report cover?

---

## 5. Layout & grid philosophy

### Layout principles

* White space is not wasted space
* Content blocks read like documents
* Evidence comes before storytelling

### Grid

* 8pt spacing system
* 12-column responsive grid (web)
* Wide margins
* Calm rhythm

### Sections hierarchy

1. What is funded
2. What happened
3. What was verified
4. What remains uncertain

Uncertainty is allowed — and visible.

---

## 6. UI components (proof-first design)

### Tables (core component)

* White background
* Thin separators
* No heavy borders
* Status indicators in muted gold / teal

### Cards

* Sand background
* Subtle radius
* No shadows or very soft shadows

### Buttons

* Primary: Deep Teal on white
* Secondary: Outline only
* Never neon

### Icons

* Line icons
* Simple, symbolic
* Consistent stroke

## 7. lil’sis mascot — refined role

lil’sis is **not a brand mascot**.
She is a **UX guide**.

### Visual direction

* Light colors
* Neutral expressions
* Small scale
* Never dominates a page

### Where she appears

* Help states
* Explanations of verification
* Onboarding for new donors

### Where she never appears

* Logos
* Financial summaries
* Verification decisions

**Phrase she embodies:**
“I’m here to help you understand — not to persuade you.”

---

## 8. Tone of visuals & content

### We show

* Data
* Evidence
* Process
* Limits

### We do not show

* Poverty porn
* Emotional manipulation
* Over-polished success stories

Photography (if any):

* Contextual
* Dignified
* No staged gratitude

---

## 9. Summary: what this brand stands for visually

This corporate design says:

> “We take donors seriously.
> We take beneficiaries seriously.
> We take proof seriously.”

It is light because it has nothing to hide.
It is calm because it does not need hype.
It is human because accountability is ultimately about people.
