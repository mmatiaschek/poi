# Donor Personas

These two personas are designed to be **decision-useful** for product design, messaging, and sales. They are grounded in the failure analysis of development aid and directly map to your POI / SIS Ledger approach.

---

## Persona 1 — The Individual Donor

### Name (archetype)

**The Accountable Patriot**

### Background

* Successful entrepreneur, executive, or professional
* Originates from Africa, India, or another emerging/developing economy
* Often part of the diaspora; educated or worked abroad
* Financially secure; giving is not about sacrifice but **responsibility**
* Has donated before — and has been disappointed at least once

### Core motivation

> “I want to improve conditions in my country — without being naïve, manipulated, or embarrassed later.”

This donor does not want charity-as-spectacle. They want **dignified, effective contribution**.

### Worldview & beliefs

* Inequality is real and structural
* External aid often fails because it is badly governed
* Local actors must be empowered — but money must come with accountability
* Transparency is respect, not bureaucracy

### Key frustrations (pain points)

* Donations disappear into large NGOs with little feedback
* Reports are glossy, vague, or clearly written for donors — not auditors
* Media scandals undermine causes they genuinely care about
* They cannot answer friends or peers when asked: “Did it actually work?”

### What they are afraid of

* Funding corruption or elite capture
* Being publicly associated with a failed or scandalized initiative
* Supporting projects that look good but do nothing on the ground

### What success looks like to them

* They can trace where their money went
* They see **proof**, not just stories
* They can stop or redirect funding if outcomes don’t materialize
* They feel pride — not moral anxiety — about their giving

### How they evaluate credibility

* Clear structure, not emotional language
* Evidence presented simply but rigorously
* Willingness to show setbacks or failure
* Systems that don’t rely on personal trust in founders

### What they want from a platform

* Transparency without complexity
* Control without micromanagement
* Proof without PR
* A way to support their country while holding implementers to high standards

### What resonates in your messaging

* “Proof over promises.”
* “Your money unlocks only verified outcomes.”
* “If it fails, you’ll see it — and funding stops.”
* “Support development without funding dysfunction.”

### Why POI / SIS Ledger fits

* Converts moral intent into verifiable action
* Protects their reputation and dignity
* Treats them as a serious stakeholder, not a wallet

## Persona 2 — The Institutional Donor

### Name (archetype)

**The Risk-Constrained Steward**

### Background

* Program officer or investment lead at:

  * development bank
  * bilateral donor agency
  * foundation
  * impact investment fund
* Operates within governance, compliance, and political constraints
* Personally mission-driven, institutionally risk-averse

### Core motivation

> “I want to fund real outcomes — and survive audits, headlines, and leadership changes.”

This donor is judged not only on impact, but on **process, defensibility, and reputation**.

### Worldview & beliefs

* Development work is hard and context-dependent
* Fraud is often systemic, not individual
* Perfect measurement is impossible, but **better verification is achievable**
* Accountability must scale across partners

### Key frustrations (pain points)

* Fragmented reporting across grantees
* Inconsistent indicators and incompatible data systems
* Audits that arrive too late to prevent damage
* Political fallout from scandals they did not cause

### What they are afraid of

* Being named in investigative journalism
* Funding being suspended due to compliance failures
* Retrospective audits uncovering issues years later
* Being blamed for implementation failures beyond their control

### What success looks like to them

* A defensible audit trail
* Standardized but flexible evidence structures
* Early warning signals when projects go off track
* The ability to say: “We followed a robust accountability process.”

### How they evaluate credibility

* Alignment with existing frameworks (DIBs, RBM, results-based finance)
* Clear separation of roles and responsibilities
* External verifiability
* Conservative claims and explicit uncertainty

### What they want from a platform

* Reduced reputational and compliance risk
* Better signal-to-noise ratio in reporting
* A system that complements — not replaces — existing processes
* A pilotable, modular solution

### What resonates in your messaging

* “Audit-ready by design.”
* “Outcome-based disbursement with reproducible evidence.”
* “Reduce risk without increasing paperwork.”
* “Scandal-resilient development finance.”

### Why POI / SIS Ledger fits

* Shifts accountability upstream
* Makes audits cheaper and earlier
* Aligns incentives without accusing partners
* Creates institutional memory beyond individuals

## Shared truth (where both personas meet)

Despite different constraints, both donors ultimately want the same thing:

> **Confidence that money turned into meaningful outcomes — and proof that can withstand scrutiny.**

This shared need is the strategic intersection your product should always return to.
